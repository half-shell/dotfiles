# dotfiles
half-shell's personnal configuration

## Description
This repo is just a versionning solution of the config i'm currently using. I'll keep it
up to date since it's the config files i'm using all the time. My main workspace is Arch Linux based, and i am using Awesome WM as my windows manager.

## GNU Stow

## Awesome config
#### ToDos
* Theming (in particulary regarding the color of borders)
* Considering using lain library to add extra layouts
* Widgets

## Vim config

#### Plug-in manager
I'm using [vim-plug] as my plugin manager, since Vundle is not maintained anymore, and updates/installations aren't done as quickly.
[vim-plug] is managed as a git submodule of my dotfiles, and  will be kept updated that way.
#### ToDos
* ~~Add support for plugins~~

##### Plugins :
* autocompletion (YouCompleteMe?)
* search utility (FZF?)
* indent

##Bash config

##Termite config

## IRSSI config
